            You know to be honest, I could care less about the data. All we use the data for is to improve the experience of the application, we do this by google analytics. If you don&apos;t want to be included in this then go to <strong>User Account &#187; Privacy &#187; Do not collect</strong>. Plus data is your & yours alone so I hate it when people make profits from user data.
